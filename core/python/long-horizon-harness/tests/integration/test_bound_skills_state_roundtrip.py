"""The ``bound_skills`` catalog written by ``bind_session_skills_callback``
must survive ADK's state-delta commit and be readable from the session
service after the turn — not merely land on a transient ``CallbackContext``.

The unit test in ``tests/unit/test_skill_catalog_state.py`` drives the
callback with a plain-dict context, which proves the *write call* but not
the round-trip through ``Runner`` + ``InMemorySessionService``. This pins
the persistence contract that ``/lha/state`` relies on.

No Vertex, no LLM: a second ``before_agent_callback`` short-circuits the
agent with a synthetic response before the model is reached, while the
real Runner machinery still commits the callback's ``state`` delta.
