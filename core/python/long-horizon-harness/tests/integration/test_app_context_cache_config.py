"""Lock the App-level context cache wiring.

The 3-tier system prompt has a large stable head whose bytes do not
change across turns within a session. Without ``ContextCacheConfig`` on
``App(...)``, every turn re-ingests those bytes — wasted Vertex spend
and added latency. This test pins the config so future refactors don't
silently drop it.
