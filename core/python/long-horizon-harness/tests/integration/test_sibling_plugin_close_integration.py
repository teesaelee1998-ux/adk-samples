"""ADK PluginManager.close() must not raise for an in-flight SiblingAgentPlugin.

Reproduces the production failure path exactly: ADK's PluginManager wraps each
plugin's close() in asyncio.timeout(close_timeout) and re-raises any exception
as RuntimeError("Failed to close plugins: ..."). With a slow sibling in flight,
the drain must finish (or be absorbed) within that budget.
