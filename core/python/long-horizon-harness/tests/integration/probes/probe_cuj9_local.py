"""CUJ-9: Local dev mode — ``LHA_ENVIRONMENT_BACKEND=local`` does NOT
touch Vertex.

Sanity check that the local fallback path stays hermetic: no template or
sandbox provisioning, even if the sandbox env vars are also set. Probes
``provision_sandbox`` is monkeypatched to raise; if anything in
``session_start`` calls it under the local backend we fail loudly.
