"""Routine fire path, end-to-end against a REAL sandbox (RUN_SANDBOX_PROBE).

The real-isolation proof for ``/scheduler/routine-tick``: a due routine must run
its turn in its OWN ``lhart-<id>`` sandbox (never the user's), in a tagged
``job_type="routine"`` session. This is the live counterpart to the deterministic
``tests/unit/scheduler/test_routine_tick.py`` (which monkeypatches the turn) — it
drives a real ADK runner + A2A handler so the env-binding (``set_routine_run`` →
``_build_routine_sandbox_environment``) actually provisions Vertex Agent Runtime.

Fixtures (``fresh_user_id``/``sandbox_env_vars``/``reset_env_cache``/
``vertex_client``) come from ``conftest.py``; the gate auto-marks this skipped
unless ``RUN_SANDBOX_PROBE=1``.

The runner/handler are built exactly as ``fast_api_app._build_app``'s lifespan does
(``build_runner`` + ``attach_a2a_routes`` over ``build_executor``) and
hung off ``app.state`` so ``routine_tick`` drives them like production. The task is
trivial and self-contained ("write hello.txt") so no secrets, network, or user
workspace are needed — ``secrets=()``.
