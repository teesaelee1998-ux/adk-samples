"""CUJ-8: Crash recovery — live sandbox survives an unclean process drop.

Simulates a crash by dropping the env reference WITHOUT calling
``close()``, then asserts the platform-side sandbox is still
``STATE_RUNNING`` and a second session reattaches to it with the
sentinel intact.

Under the persistent-sandbox model the sandbox lives independently of
the Python process — there is no snapshot/atexit dance to validate.
The interesting failure mode is "did we leak a sandbox that vanished
on process exit" — proven false by ``sandboxes.get`` returning
RUNNING after the simulated crash.
