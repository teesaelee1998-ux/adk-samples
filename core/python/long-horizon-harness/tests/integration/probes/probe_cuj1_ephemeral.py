"""CUJ-1: Ephemeral exploration — fresh user, no prior state, nothing persists.

Pins: a session that never opts in to a persistent identity gets cleaned up.
Specifically, after ``close()`` the sandbox resource is gone (the snapshot
index does pick up the throwaway user's snapshot because ``close()`` always
snapshots — but the resource itself must not linger and burn quota).
