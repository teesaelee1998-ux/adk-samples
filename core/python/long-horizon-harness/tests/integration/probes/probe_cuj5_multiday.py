"""CUJ-5: Multi-day project continuity — state accumulates across N sessions.

Snapshot+restore must be durable through repeated round-trips, not just one.
The probe runs three sequential sessions, each one provisions from the prior
snapshot, appends a line to ``journal.md``, then closes. After the third,
provision a fourth read-only session and verify all three lines are present
in the exact order they were written.
