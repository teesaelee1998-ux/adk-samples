"""CUJ-7: Parallel sessions for same ``user_id`` — both succeed, one wins.

Two ``_build_sandbox_environment(user_id)`` calls executed concurrently with
``asyncio.gather`` must both come back with a working sandbox (no Vertex
rejection, no race in the index helpers). Both write a sentinel; after both
close, a third session reads the snapshot and must observe ONE of the
sentinels — last-writer-wins is acceptable, both losing is not.
