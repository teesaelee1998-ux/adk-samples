"""End-to-end lifecycle of the background-process surface, exercising
the real ``terminal`` and ``process`` tools against ``LocalEnvironment``
(no LLM in the loop).

Covers the three flows the model is taught to drive:

  1. Explicit ``background=True`` spawn → registry lookup → kill.
  2. Auto-promote (``timeout_s=1`` on a sleep that outlives it) → the
     handle is registered and ``process(wait)`` returns its exit.
  3. Interactive recovery: ``process(write)`` unblocks a ``read``-waiting
     command and the next ``poll`` shows the line was consumed.
