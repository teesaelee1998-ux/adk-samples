"""Lock the App-level compaction wiring.

Asserts the production ``App(...)`` exposes both trigger modes of
``EventsCompactionConfig`` and uses the lha summarizer subclass. End-to-end
compaction behavior (does the summary preserve user intent, does the model
stay coherent across compactions) belongs in evals, not pytest.
