"""``_env_cache`` keeps the second request warm.

If the first request through ``/a2a`` for ``lha_user_id=X``
provisions a sandbox and stashes it in ``_env_cache``, the second
request for the same X should NOT re-provision. We can't directly
inspect the in-process cache from a subprocess, so we measure the
proxy: time-to-first-byte should drop on the second call by more than
the noise floor.

This test is intentionally loose: it asserts the ratio, not absolute
numbers, so it survives slow CI hosts and warm GCP regions. Treat a
failure as a signal to investigate ``horizon/conversation/session_start.py``
not as a perf gate.

    a2a 1.x emits the initial ``submitted`` task event immediately, and on the
