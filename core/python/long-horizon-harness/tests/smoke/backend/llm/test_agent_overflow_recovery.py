"""LLM-driven: agent recovers a needle from overflowed terminal output.

A command's oversized output is spilled by ``terminal`` to ``lha/tool-output/``
with only a preview + pointer returned. The needle sits past the preview, so the
agent must follow the pointer (``view_file`` / ``read_file`` / grep) to answer.
The overflow is triggered in setup (a capable model would otherwise grep/tail to
avoid overflowing); this exercises the recovery half end-to-end.

Assertions target durable side effects + the needle in the final answer —
never model phrasing. The needle is a deterministic token we planted, not free
text — see the project agent guidance: "Never assert on LLM output content in
pytest."
