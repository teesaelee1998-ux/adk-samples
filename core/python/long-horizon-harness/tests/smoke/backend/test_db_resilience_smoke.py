"""Gated live disconnect-recovery probe.

Real-Postgres resilience can't be unit-tested; this probe validates the retry
path end-to-end by forcibly terminating the backend mid-operation and asserting
the wrapped call still succeeds. Set RUN_DB_RESILIENCE_PROBE=1 and LHA_PROBE_DB_URL
to run against a throwaway Postgres.
