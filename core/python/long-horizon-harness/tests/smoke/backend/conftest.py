"""Session-scoped sandbox + per-test glue for the backend smoke suite.

One sandbox is provisioned at session start and reused across every
backend smoke test — provisioning is the expensive op (multi-second
cold start hitting Agent Engine); routing through one shared instance
keeps the suite from paying that cost N times.

If ``LHA_RUNTIME_IMAGE`` and ``LHA_SANDBOX_CALLER_SA`` are unset,
``_build_sandbox_environment`` silently degrades to a ``LocalEnvironment``
under a per-session tmpdir — that path is still worth exercising
because the artifact pipeline, callbacks, and tool dispatch all share
code regardless of backend.
