"""``search_files`` (regex + mtime ranking) and ``read_file`` (line-numbered
output + trailer) route through the shared environment.

Direct tool-call rather than LLM-driven — same pattern as
``test_terminal_tool.py`` / ``test_file_ops_tool.py``. The smoke contract is
"tool dispatch + env wiring works against the real backend"; LLM behavior is
covered by ``tests/eval``. Files and mtimes are set through the env interface
(``write_file`` / ``terminal``) so the test exercises the sandbox path too.
