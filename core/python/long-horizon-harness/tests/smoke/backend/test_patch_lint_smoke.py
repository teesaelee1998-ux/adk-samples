"""``patch`` fuzzy replacer + post-edit ruff diagnostics through the env interface.

Direct tool-call rather than LLM-driven — same pattern as
``test_terminal_tool.py`` / ``test_search_and_read_smoke.py``. The smoke
contract is twofold:

1. The fuzzy replacer ladder (``horizon/tools/_replacers.py``) resolves an
   ``old_string`` that differs from the file only by whitespace/indentation
   and applies the edit end-to-end through ``env.read_file`` /
   ``env.write_file`` — proving the ladder runs against the real backend.
2. Post-edit ruff diagnostics degrade cleanly: ``_post_edit_diagnostics``
   issues ``ruff check --output-format=json`` via ``env.execute`` and MUST
   NOT raise — when ruff is in the sandbox image the result carries a
   ``diagnostics`` string referencing the edited file; when ruff is absent
   the key is simply omitted. A missing-ruff sandbox image is an ACCEPTED
   degraded path (ship-ruff-in-the-image is a separate Dockerfile follow-up).

LLM behavior is covered by ``tests/eval``; the fuzzy-edit *agent* path is
covered by ``tests/smoke/backend/llm/test_agent_fuzzy_edit.py``.
