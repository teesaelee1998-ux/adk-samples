"""Sidebar titles must derive from the FIRST user message, never a recent one.

TITLE_KEY is set only by the rename endpoint, so an un-renamed chat derives its
title by scanning events for the first user message. The list view fetches a
bounded recent-events window for perf; that window keeps the MOST RECENT events,
so a long un-renamed chat would otherwise show a recent message as its title.
These tests pin the title to the oldest user message regardless of how many
later events exist.
