"""``halt_consumer_callback`` response-shape tests.

Replaces the would-be ``guardrail_halt.evalset.json`` behavioral evalset.
The evalset shape was rejected because ``halt_consumer_callback`` is wired
as a ``before_model_callback`` whose halt path is deterministic Python. An
evalset grading "what the model says when halted" would tautologically
grade Python's hardcoded string. Pinning the response shape
deterministically here is the right home: same coverage, no LLM cost.

Halt handling is two-phase. The FIRST turn after a halt latches runs a
graceful handoff: it strips tools off the per-turn ``llm_request`` and
appends a text-only handoff ``<system-reminder>``, then returns ``None``
so the model produces one final text turn. EVERY subsequent turn (handoff
already delivered) returns the bare ``[halted: <reason>]`` ``LlmResponse``.
This file pins the bare-response shape on that second-and-later path, and
the graceful-handoff mutation on the first path.

The state-setting side (RepeatedFailureGuard, NoProgressGuard) is
covered in ``test_guardrails.py``. The two halves together pin the full
contract: guards write the key, halt_consumer reads it, both agree on
the spelling.
