"""file_ops hardening pack — 8 safety/edge cases not covered by test_file_ops.

Pins safety gaps in ``horizon/tools/file_ops.py`` not covered by the base
test file (``test_file_ops.py``), which covers happy-path
read/write/patch/search, the write-side deny list, and a few
binary/encoding fallbacks. This pack adds the safety edges that path
doesn't reach.

Implementation notes for ``horizon/tools/file_ops.py`` (~30 LOC):

  A. Character-device/FIFO/socket blocking in ``read_file``:
       reading ``/dev/urandom`` via ``Path.read_text`` will hang
       indefinitely (the call blocks waiting for bytes that never EOF).
       Reading a FIFO/socket has the same failure mode. Add a guard
       that rejects any non-regular file early.

  B. ``_MAX_READ_CHARS = 200_000`` cap in ``read_file``: an
       unbounded read can blow the model's context window with a
       single tool call. Cap the returned ``content`` (after offset/
       limit selection) and surface the truncation in the result so
       the model knows to paginate.

  D. ``read_file`` deny-list gating: the existing
       ``_is_write_denied`` blocks WRITES to /etc/passwd, ~/.ssh/*,
       etc. ``read_file`` does NOT consult this list — so the model
       can read /etc/passwd and exfiltrate it. Either extend
       ``_is_write_denied`` to gate reads too, or add a parallel
       ``_is_read_denied`` covering at least the secrets-bearing
       paths (/etc/shadow, ~/.ssh/id_*, ~/.aws/credentials, .netrc,
       .pgpass, ~/.gnupg, ~/.docker/config.json).

  E. (Parity test only — no impl change expected.) ``read_file``
       already uses ``errors="replace"`` so non-UTF8 bytes don't
       raise. This pack pins that behavior so a future refactor that
       drops ``errors="replace"`` is caught.

  F. Symlink-into-denied-path block: a symlink at
       ``~/innocent.txt`` pointing to ``/etc/shadow`` must be
       blocked. ``_is_write_denied`` already calls ``os.path.realpath``,
       but no test pins the symlink path. This pack adds that test
       for writes AND extends the contract to reads (paired with D).

Three docs/parity tests in the same file pin invariants that are
easy to regress under refactor:

  G. The cap constant is exported at module surface as
       ``_MAX_READ_CHARS`` so the value is greppable and tunable in
       one place.

  H. ``read_file(offset=0)`` is treated the same as ``offset=1`` —
       pins the 1-indexed convention against a "fixed an off-by-one"
       regression. Parity with lha ``file_tools.py`` semantics.

  I. ``search_files`` does NOT follow symlinks out of its search
       root — pins that ``os.walk`` is called without
       ``followlinks=True``. Important because a symlink in the
       repo pointing to ``/`` would otherwise cause search to walk
       the entire filesystem.

The tests in this module are written so that they will FAIL on the
current impl and PASS after the ~30 LOC impl delta. Each test names
the gap in its docstring so a future reader knows what's being pinned.

Surface assumption: the implementation will live in
``horizon/tools/file_ops.py`` and expose either ``_MAX_READ_CHARS`` (for
test G) and either ``_is_read_denied`` (a new helper) or an extended
``_is_write_denied`` that also gates reads. The contracts pinned by
the tests are stable across either naming choice.
