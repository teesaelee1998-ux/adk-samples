"""Halt-state clearing at the user-turn boundary.

Pairs with ``test_halt_consumer_response_shape.py``: that file pins the
read-only halt *consumer*, this file pins the wrapper that *acknowledges*
the halt. Together they prevent the latch bug where ``halt_reason``,
once set, would brick the session forever — every subsequent model call
short-circuits, and the streak counters stay at-threshold so even
clearing only the reason would re-trip the halt on the next event.

The acknowledgment runs in ``on_session_start_callback`` (wired as
``before_agent_callback``, fires once per user-turn invocation). The
contract enforced here:

1. ``clear_halt_state`` clears all three signals: ``halt_reason``, the
   per-tool failure streak, and the no-progress streak + last-text.
2. After ``clear_halt_state``, ``halt_consumer_callback`` returns
   ``None`` (the model is allowed to run).
3. After ``clear_halt_state``, a single subsequent failure does NOT
   re-trip ``RepeatedFailureGuard`` — proving the streak counter was
   actually reset, not just the reason.
4. After ``clear_halt_state``, a single subsequent identical response
   does NOT re-trip ``NoProgressGuard`` — same reasoning.
5. ``on_session_start_callback`` calls ``clear_halt_state`` on every
   invocation (not just the first), so subsequent user turns unbrick.
