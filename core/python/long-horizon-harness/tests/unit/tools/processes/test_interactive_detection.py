"""Tests for the interactive-prompt heuristic.

``detect_interactive_prompt(tail, idle_seconds)`` returns the matched
prompt fragment (or None) iff the process has been idle long enough AND
the output tail matches a known prompt pattern. False positives on
non-prompt output (`Done.`, log lines ending in `?` in the middle of
text) must NOT fire.
