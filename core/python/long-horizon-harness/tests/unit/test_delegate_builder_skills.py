"""Delegate-builder skill catalog resolves through the session's host mirror.

The decisive case mirrors the W1 sandbox fix: a sandbox-style env whose
``working_dir`` does not exist on the host must still surface its user skills
to a delegated child, because they are served only through the async
``list_directory`` / ``read_file`` interface and mirrored to a host cache at
session start.
