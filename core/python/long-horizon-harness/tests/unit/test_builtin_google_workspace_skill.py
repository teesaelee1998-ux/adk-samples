"""Guards for the bundled ``google-workspace`` usage skill.

The skill is what an agent loads when a user asks about Gmail/Drive/Chat.
It MUST steer the agent to try the pre-injected ``GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_TOKEN``
before the OAuth loopback-login dance — the regression we hit when "can you
see my emails?" triggered a full ``gws auth login`` flow despite the token
being present and usable.
