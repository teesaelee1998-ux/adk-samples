"""The served A2A card must stay consumable by v0.3 clients (Gemini Enterprise).

a2a 1.x serves a 1.0 card (interfaces nested in ``supportedInterfaces``). GE's
Discovery Engine validator still requires the 0.3 shape (top-level ``url`` +
``protocolVersion``). ``attach_a2a_routes`` advertises an extra v0.3
``AgentInterface`` via ``card_modifier``, which makes a2a-sdk also emit the 0.3
top-level fields — so modern 1.0 clients and GE both work off one endpoint.
