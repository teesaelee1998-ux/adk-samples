"""Per-session ``Environment`` lookup via ``ContextVar``.

The active environment is the storage abstraction skills and (later)
file/shell tools use to read and write persistent state. It is
installed at session start by ``before_agent_callback`` and torn down
at session end. Tests install one directly to exercise IO without
running the ADK runtime.

A ``ContextVar`` (not a module global) so concurrent sessions running
in the same process don't see each other's environments — each
``asyncio.Task`` inherits its own snapshot.
