"""``POST /scheduler/dream-review`` — daily cross-session memory pass.

Body: ``{"user_ids": [], "app_name": "lha"}``. An **empty** ``user_ids``
(what the nightly cron sends) means "every user with a session in the
lookback window" — discovered via :func:`list_active_users`. A non-empty
list targets those users explicitly.

For each user it calls :func:`horizon.memory.dream_review._run_dream_review_for_user`,
forwarding the runner-bound ``memory_service`` + ``session_service`` (from
``app.state.runner``) so the user's recent session events can be read and handed
to Memory Bank's ``generate`` to consolidate their Structured Profile. The
``app_name`` is taken from the runner (where sessions are actually keyed), not
the request body. Sums the ``success: True`` results into
``{"reviewed": N, "failed": M}``.
