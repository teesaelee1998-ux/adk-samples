"""Tagging convention for sessions created by scheduled jobs.

Every cron/scheduled job (reminder firings, dream-review) routes its
session through ``create_scheduled_session`` so the web UI can group and
search them. The tag lives in ``session.state`` under the keys defined in
``horizon/infrastructure/constants.py``; ``horizon/api/sessions.py`` reads them
back to filter the ``/lha/sessions`` list.
