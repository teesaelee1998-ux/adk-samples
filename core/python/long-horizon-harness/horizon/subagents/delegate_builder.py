"""Lazy builder — constructs a fresh child ``Agent`` per delegate call.

goal + context + skills go into the system prompt; toolsets expand into
the tool list; a blocklist strips anything the child must not call.

No caching — the prompt is goal-specific, so a per-call build is cheap
and removes a class of cache-staleness bugs (skill body updates, toolset
changes, blocklist tweaks).
