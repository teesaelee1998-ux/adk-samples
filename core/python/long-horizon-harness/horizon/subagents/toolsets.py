"""Static toolset registry — the catalogue the dynamic delegate dispatches against.

The dynamic ``delegate`` tool materializes a child agent's tool list from this
registry. The LLM names
toolsets (``["file", "shell"]``); the delegate runner expands those to
the concrete tool callables and hands them to the child.
