"""Web-research sub-agent — isolates ``google_search`` from the root agent's tool set.

Gemini's API rejects any request that combines ``google_search`` with
non-search function tools::

    "Multiple tools are supported only when they are all search tools."

The root agent ships ~10 function tools (file_ops, terminal,
memory, ...), so ``google_search`` cannot live alongside them. The
documented escape hatch is the sub-agent split: a dedicated agent whose
``tools=[]`` is JUST the search tool, surfaced to the root agent through
``AgentTool``. The root agent calls the sub-agent like a function;
the sub-agent makes a search-only API call internally.

The surfaced tool name is ``web_research`` — naming it ``search_agent``
made the model reach for ``terminal``-based scraping instead, because
"search" reads as filesystem/memory search.
