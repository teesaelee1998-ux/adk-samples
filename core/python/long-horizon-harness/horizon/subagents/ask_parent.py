"""``ask_parent`` — a delegated child's escalation channel to the parent.

A blocking ``delegate`` drives a resumable child. When the child hits a genuine
blocker only the parent can resolve, it calls ``ask_parent(question)``: the
question bubbles up the same resurfacing path an approval uses, the parent turn
answers (free text), and the child resumes in place with the answer. Outside a
resurfacing drain (background ``agent`` / routine, or no interactive channel)
there is no parent to ask, so it returns a graceful "use your best judgment"
answer rather than hanging. One escalation per delegated task (it spends the same
single bubble budget as an approval).
