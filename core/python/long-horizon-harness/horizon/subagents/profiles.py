"""Deny-by-default child archetypes for delegated sub-agents.

A ``ChildProfile`` with a non-None ``allowed_tool_names`` turns a child
into an allowlist sandbox: only the named tools may run, enforced by the
child-scoped ``before_tool_callback`` (see ``child_guard.py``). The
``"explore"`` profile is the read-only researcher — file reads + search,
no writes, no shell, no network.
