"""Slash-command dispatcher for ``before_model_callback``.

Intercepts ``/<cmd>`` user turns. A built-in command short-circuits the
turn — its reply is returned as an ``LlmResponse`` and the model never
runs. A ``/<name>`` that matches a bound skill is rewritten in place and
passed through to the model (returns ``None``), which then runs the skill.
