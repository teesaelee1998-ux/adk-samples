"""Horizon — a reference long-horizon ADK agent.

- The agent: ``horizon.agent`` (``root_agent`` / ``app``).
- Served over HTTP: ``horizon.fast_api_app:app`` (``uvicorn horizon.fast_api_app:app``).
- Embedded headless: ``horizon.fast_api_app.build_runner()`` → an ADK ``Runner``.

Configure via environment variables (see ``docs/configuration.md``); adapt by
editing the code — this is a sample, not a framework.
