"""Graceful budget/guardrail halt: one final text-only handoff turn.

Instead of short-circuiting the model with a bare `[halted: ...]`
response, the halt consumers call apply_graceful_halt to strip tools and
inject a handoff reminder, then return None so the model produces a
final text turn: what it did, what remains, what it recommends.

Modeled on opencode's approach — but adapted to ADK: opencode
disables tools at the harness layer; here we strip tools off the
per-turn LlmRequest and let the model run once more.
