"""Connection-resilience defaults for the SQL-backed session/task stores.

A Cloud SQL maintenance event or HA failover briefly drops connections. Without
these, the pooled connections go stale and every request 500s until the Cloud
Run instances are cycled by hand. `pool_pre_ping` discards a dead connection on
checkout and opens a fresh one; `pool_recycle` caps connection lifetime so they
rotate before the server times them out; `connect_args.timeout` bounds a refused
connect (asyncpg) so it fails fast and is retried. `pool_pre_ping` only validates
at checkout — `is_transient_disconnect` + `retry_on_disconnect` cover the
mid-flight and connect-time drops it cannot.
