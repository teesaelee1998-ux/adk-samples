"""Artifact extraction — bridge the per-user workspace and ADK's
``ArtifactService``.

A single ``artifact(action='save'|'load')`` dispatch:

* ``save``: hand a finished workspace file off to whatever artifact
  service the runner configured (``InMemoryArtifactService`` in unit/dev,
  ``GcsArtifactService`` in deploy).
* ``load``: pull a previously-saved artifact back into the workspace so
  a follow-up turn can edit it.

Without this, the only way to get a file out of the sandbox is to
``terminal cat`` it and copy from stdout — fine for ASCII, useless for
anything binary.

      inline where the client supports it, otherwise as a link). Requires
      ``path`` (workspace-relative or absolute under working_dir). The artifact
      is stored under just the basename so callers refer to it without leaking
      workspace structure. The saved file is shown to the user automatically
      with an openable link — refer to it by name; do not write your own link,
      URL, or a 'here's your file' line in your reply.
      ``inline`` (default True) renders static content in the tab;
      pass ``inline=False`` for HTML that needs JavaScript so the link downloads
      it for the user to open locally (scripts don't run in the inline viewer).
    - ``load``: write a previously-saved artifact back into the workspace
      at ``dest_path``. Requires ``name`` (the artifact filename
      returned by ``save``) and ``dest_path`` (where in the workspace to
      drop it).
