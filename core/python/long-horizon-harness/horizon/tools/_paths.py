"""Shared path-under-root resolver for tools that operate on the env root.

``file_ops``, ``terminal``, and ``processes.terminal`` all need the same
trust-boundary check: resolve a possibly-relative path against the
active environment's ``working_dir`` and reject anything that escapes
via ``..`` or absolute paths outside the root. Each caller wraps the
error string in whatever envelope shape it returns.

    Relative paths join under ``root``; absolute paths must already be
    within it. On success returns ``(resolved, None)``; on escape
    returns ``(None, message)`` so callers can format their own error
    envelopes.
