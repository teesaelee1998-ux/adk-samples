"""Bind the live ``SkillToolset`` to a session and refresh its catalog.

ADK leaves ``SkillToolset._skills`` mutable and sets
``_use_invocation_cache = False`` precisely so the catalog can change
mid-session. ``bind_toolset`` registers the per-session roots;
``refresh_skills`` re-walks those roots and replaces ``_skills`` in
place. The ``/reload`` slash command and model-facing ``reload`` tool
in ``horizon/commands/`` call ``resync_and_refresh``, which first re-mirrors
the user's skills from the env interface so sandbox-side edits land on the
host before the re-walk.
