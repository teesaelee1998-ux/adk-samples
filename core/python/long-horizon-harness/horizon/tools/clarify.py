"""Clarify tool — ADK HITL question/answer surface.

First call: invoke ``tool_context.request_confirmation(hint=question,
payload={...})`` so ADK enqueues the pending confirmation in
``event_actions.requested_tool_confirmations[function_call_id]``. The
front-end renders the question, captures the user's answer, and resumes
the tool call with a ``ToolConfirmation`` whose ``payload`` carries the
answer (or ``confirmed=False`` to decline).
