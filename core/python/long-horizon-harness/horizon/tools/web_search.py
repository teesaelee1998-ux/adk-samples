"""Web search via ADK's ``google_search`` built-in (Path A).

Re-exports ADK's ``google_search`` singleton so consumers can import it
from the same ``horizon.tools.*`` surface as our other tools. Path A means
the tool is a model-side built-in — Gemini's native search-grounding
fires when the singleton is registered on an Agent's ``tools`` list,
without any local HTTP client or provider plugin layer.

Earlier iterations shipped a large multi-provider web-search registry
(DuckDuckGo / SearXNG / Exa / Tavily); this drops the whole abstraction
in favor of native grounding.
