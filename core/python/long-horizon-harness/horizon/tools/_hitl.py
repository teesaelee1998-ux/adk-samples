"""Shared HITL (human-in-the-loop) confirmation helper for tools.

Every tool that gates on a user prompt — ``terminal``, ``clarify``, future
confirm-tier tools — needs the same plumbing: check ``tool_confirmation``;
if missing, dispatch ``request_confirmation(...)`` and mark
``actions.skip_summarization`` so the kickoff response isn't paraphrased.

This helper performs only the request side. Callers still decide what to
do with the returned ``ToolConfirmation`` (pending / declined / confirmed)
since the success/decline envelopes differ per tool.
