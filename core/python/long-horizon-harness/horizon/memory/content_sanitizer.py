"""Sanitize event content before it is replayed into Memory Bank's
``memories.generate``.

Memory Bank's server-side extractor (a Gemini model) ingests text plus
standard image/PDF media; it rejects any other ``inline_data`` mime with a
400 ("Unable to submit request because it has a mimeType parameter with
value ..., which is not supported"). Stored session events can legitimately
carry such blobs — a user uploads a ``.json`` file, or ``view_file`` injects
one — so the nightly dream pass must degrade them to a short text placeholder
before generation.
