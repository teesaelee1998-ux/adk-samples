"""Pre-compaction memory flush — extract durable user facts before they vanish.

Fires once when ``HorizonSummarizer`` is about to compact events (ADK's
``EventsCompactionConfig`` summarizer hook). A narrowly-scoped sibling
agent (``add_memory`` only) walks the soon-to-be-compacted events and
saves anything worth keeping. Mirrors the structure of
``horizon/memory/review_fork.py`` but with a sharper toolset and a flush-
focused prompt.

Gated by ``LHA_PRE_COMPRESS_FLUSH`` (default on). Set to ``0`` in eval
harnesses where the extra LLM cost would distort baselines.

Recursion guard is structural — the fork's ``Agent`` has no
``after_agent_callback`` chain, and the whitelist blocks every tool except
``add_memory``.
