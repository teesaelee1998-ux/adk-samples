"""Per-session throttling for after-turn fork-style callbacks.

``auto_capture_callback`` and ``review_fork_callback`` fire on every parent
turn and each kick off (or perform) work that may end up calling Gemini.
On bursts of short user turns that's wasteful — the second invocation runs
while the first is still in flight against a near-identical snapshot.

``try_claim`` enforces two limits, keyed per fork type in session state:

* a cooldown window (``_FORK_COOLDOWN_SECONDS``, default 120s) between
  consecutive runs of the same type, and
* a per-session cap (``_FORK_PER_SESSION_CAP``, default 50) as a safety
  valve against runaway loops.

Set ``LHA_FORK_COOLDOWN=0`` to disable the cooldown (the cap still
applies) — used by evalsets that need every-turn behavior to score the
underlying logic without throttling noise.

``flush_fork.spawn_flush_fork`` and ``dream_review.request_dream_review``
are intentionally NOT routed through ``try_claim``: flush fires at most
once per session (right before compression) and dream-review is on-demand,
so per-turn cooldown is not the right shape for either.
