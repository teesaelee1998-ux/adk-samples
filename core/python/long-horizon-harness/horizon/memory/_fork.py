"""Pure helpers shared by fork-style review agents.

Owns the snapshot/event helpers and the whitelist-callback factory that
the three fork modules (``review_fork``, ``flush_fork``, ``dream_review``)
use to format their conversation input and gate their toolsets. The
runner / task-lifecycle plumbing they used to share now lives in
``horizon/memory/sibling_agent_plugin.py``.
