"""Skill curator pass — inline promotion/review based on session telemetry.

Runs the promotion logic inline as an ``after_agent_callback`` using simple
numeric thresholds:

* ``MIN_MANAGES_FOR_PROMOTION = 3`` — three successful edits to the
  same skill in one session is a strong "the agent is actively shaping
  this skill" signal (each ``skill`` mutate action bumps the skill's
  patch count).
* ``MIN_VIEWS_FOR_REVIEW = 5`` — five reads with zero edits flags a
  skill that's load-bearing context but never refined ("view-heavy,
  patch-light").
