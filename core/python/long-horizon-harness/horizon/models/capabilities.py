"""Per-backend capability descriptors.

Each model backend carries a ``ModelCapabilities`` (max inline-image bytes, a
``can_view_mime`` predicate, and an optional pre-dispatch ``prepare_contents``
hook). The dispatcher and ``view_file`` read the capabilities by data, so
neither names a concrete backend class: adding a model is one descriptor entry,
and a model with unusual media limits or content quirks sets its own fields
instead of adding an ``isinstance`` branch.

Kept a leaf module (imports only genai types) so the registry can reference the
descriptors without an import cycle through the dispatcher.
