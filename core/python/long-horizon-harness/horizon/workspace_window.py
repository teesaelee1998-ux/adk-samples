"""Per-session workspace window — a default scope + view, never a security boundary.

A session may anchor itself to one or more workspace-relative dirs (the
"window"). Path tools resolve their default (``.``) and relative names through
``resolve_in_window`` so they foreground the window instead of the whole shared
per-user workspace. The real trust gate stays ``horizon.tools._paths.path_under_root``
— it runs last on every resolution, so any in-root path (``/``-prefixed or naming
another subdir) still reaches the whole workspace. The window narrows the
*default*, never *access*.

Stored per-session in ``session.state`` (mirrors ``selected_model`` and the
per-session todo scoping). Absent/empty ⇒ whole workspace (back-compat).
