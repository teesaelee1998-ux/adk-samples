"""Per-session compaction context — memory-service handles for the summarizer.

``EventsCompactionConfig`` is set on the ``App`` at module load, before
any session exists, so the summarizer must defer per-session state lookup
to call time. This ContextVar is set in ``on_session_start_callback``
once the invocation context is known and read by ``HorizonSummarizer`` when
deciding whether to fire the pre-compaction flush fork.

Mirrors the shape of ``horizon/environment_context.py`` so the same hermetic
teardown pattern applies in tests.
