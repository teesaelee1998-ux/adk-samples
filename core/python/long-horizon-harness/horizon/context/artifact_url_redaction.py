"""Hide signed artifact URLs from the model's view of tool results.

``artifact(action='save')`` returns a private signed GCS URL so display clients
can open the file (the web UI renders the A2A FilePart; Gemini Enterprise gets a
``📎`` link lifted from the function_response by ``a2a/executor.py``). That URL
also lands in the function_response the model reads on its continuation turn, and
the model pastes the whole credentialed blob into its reply. The clients already
render the link, so the model never needs the URL.

This redacts ``llm_request.contents`` — the deep copy ADK builds from
``session.events`` and actually sends to the model (ADK deep-copies the events
into the request, so a before_model callback must mutate the request, not the
events).
The signed URL stays in ``session.events`` (and on the wire), so the A2A
converter and saved task history still surface the link to the client.
