"""Central permission gate (before_tool_callback).

Read-only and self-confirming tools pass through. Everything else resolves a
decision from the layered rules (defaults → .lha/permissions.jsonl → session
grants) and, when the decision is ask_user, dispatches ADK's
request_confirmation and pauses; on resume it records the grant per the chosen
outcome (gemini ToolConfirmationOutcome vocabulary).
