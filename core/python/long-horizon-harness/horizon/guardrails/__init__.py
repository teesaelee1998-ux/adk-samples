"""Tool guardrails for the ADK agent — two callback families.

**before_tool tool-guards (the risky-operation gate).** Each is an ADK
``before_tool_callback`` with the same contract:

    async def guard(*, tool, args, tool_context) -> dict | None

Return ``None`` to allow the tool; return a ``dict`` (carrying an ``error``
key) to block it — ADK surfaces that dict to the model as the tool result, so
the call never runs. They are registered as an *ordered* list in ``agent.py``'s
``before_tool_callback`` and run top-to-bottom; later guards only see what
earlier ones allowed:

* ``exfil_guard`` (Layer A) — blocks secret-bearing / upload-shaped calls to
  non-allowlisted hosts. The before_tool shell is the transferable part; the
  bulk of the file is exfil-detection heuristics.
* ``policies_guard`` (Layer C) — hard-deny + confirmation from tenant policy.
* ``permission_guard`` (Layer D) — the interactive allow/ask layer; runs last.

To write your own, copy the contract above: one ``async`` function with that
signature returning ``None`` or an ``{"error": ...}`` dict, added to the
``before_tool_callback`` list. Deep dives: ``docs/security-model.md`` (the
per-layer model) and ``docs/permission-model.md``.

**Halt guards** — three thin shapes wired into other ADK slots, all
publishing/reading one state key (``HALT_REASON_STATE_KEY``) so a single
user-visible halt cause surfaces regardless of which fired:

* ``RepeatedFailureGuard`` — ``after_tool_callback`` that halts when the
  SAME (tool_name, canonical args) keeps failing.
* ``NoProgressGuard`` — ``after_model_callback`` that halts when the model
  emits identical text ``window`` turns in a row.
* ``halt_consumer_callback`` — ``before_model_callback`` that short-
  circuits with an ``LlmResponse`` when ``halt_reason`` is set.

    clearing the reason alone would re-trip the halt on the next event.
