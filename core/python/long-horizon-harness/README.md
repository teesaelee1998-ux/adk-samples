  <h1>Long Horizon</h1>
  <h3>A reference implementation of an agent harness on ADK and Google's Agent Platform.</h3>
</div>

Long Horizon shows how to build a long-horizon harness on ADK with capabilities like cross-session memory, a per-user sandbox, tool guardrails, sub-agents, and a self-improvement loop. Read it, then lift the patterns into your own agent.

- **Study the components** — [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), where each row links to the function to start from
- **Run it yourself** — [Quickstart](#quickstart)
- **Understand the design** — [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)
- **Review the security model** — [`docs/security-model.md`](docs/security-model.md), before pointing it at anything real

**Features:**

*Memory & self-improvement*

- **Cross-session memory** — recalls facts and preferences across conversations, prefetched every turn from Memory Bank via `PreloadMemoryTool`.
- **Background self-improvement** — the agent gets better the more you use it: it saves what's worth remembering to memory, and occasionally learns a new technique, without slowing down the reply to the user.
- **It dreams** — nightly, a cross-session pass surfaces what no single conversation can (mention it Monday, it's surfaced by Friday) and consolidates scattered memories into one profile. See [`docs/memory.md`](docs/memory.md).

*Sandbox & secrets*

- **Per-user sandbox** — a JWT-routed BYOC [Sandbox](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/scale/sandbox), warm between turns and reattached on the next message (snapshot survival opt-in). See [`docs/sandbox-lifecycle.md`](docs/sandbox-lifecycle.md).
- **Bring-your-own secrets** — API keys live per-user in Secret Manager and inject into sandbox commands; the model sees the name, never the value. Bulk-import via `.env` upload.
- **Connect Google** — one-click OAuth wires `gcloud`/`bq` and the `gws` Workspace CLI into your sandbox; tokens are stored as per-user secrets, never shown to the model. Bring your own OAuth client — [setup](docs/quickstart.md#6-connect-google-optional-oauth).

*Integration & extensibility*

- **A2A-native** — any agent or script drives Horizon over A2A (agent-to-agent), and it streams structured UI parts back over the same channel. No custom frontend per feature.
- **Sub-agents** — blocking `delegate` and fire-and-forget `agent`, each with its own context window and toolset.
- **Skills & custom scripts** — drop a `SKILL.md` or a `scripts/<name>.py` in the workspace and `/reload` picks it up mid-session. No fork, no redeploy.
- **Reminders & scheduled chats** — reminders fire as real, persisted chats in a "Scheduled" folder, viewable and replayable in the web UI.

*Reliability & safety*

- **Resumability + compaction** — sessions resume cleanly; `HorizonSummarizer` compresses old turns so context stays focused on what's current.
- **Guardrails** — iteration-budget, no-progress, and repeated-failure halts share one `halt_reason` and reset together at the turn boundary.
- **Self-reporting** — the agent files structured reports to maintainers (HITL-gated), and users can send feedback.

## The stack

| Layer | What |
|---|---|
| **Runner** | ADK 2.5.x — plugins, callback graph, resumability, events compaction |
| **Model** | Gemini 3.6 Flash (root, default) · Flash Latest (web research) |
| **Memory** | [Memory Bank](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/scale/memory-bank) (managed store) **+** a custom self-improvement loop (throttled judge fork, pre-compaction flush, nightly dream-review consolidation) — see [`docs/memory.md`](docs/memory.md) |
| **Sessions** | [Agent Platform Sessions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/scale/sessions) |
| **Sandbox** | [Sandboxes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/scale/sandbox) (BYOC container) — one per user, JWT-routed; reattached between turns (snapshot survival opt-in) |
| **Frontend** | Vite 8 + TanStack Router/Query + React 18 |
| **Surface** | Cloud Run + Cloud SQL + Cloud Scheduler — Cloud Run scales to zero between turns (Cloud SQL bills continuously) |

Custom code earns its keep in a handful of **interfaces** on top of the managed primitives: the tool-guardrail chain, the `Environment` ContextVar sandbox layer, the per-user secret store, the dynamic delegate + HITL resurfacing, the three-tier system-prompt assembler, and the self-improvement loop layered on managed Memory Bank (throttled judge fork, pre-compaction flush, nightly dream-review; see [`docs/memory.md`](docs/memory.md)). Compaction, resumability, and prefix caching are ADK/Vertex knobs Horizon only configures; routines and the scheduler are applications composed from the interfaces. (Those interfaces are the rows in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).)

## Quickstart

**Run it locally.** For the step-by-step, see [`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md).

### Prerequisites

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), [google-agents-cli](https://pypi.org/project/google-agents-cli/) (`uv tool install google-agents-cli` — provides the `agents-cli` command), [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install), `make`, and Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ (Vite 8 — web UI only). On Windows, use WSL.

### Setup and run

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter this sample
git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
cd adk-samples/core/python/long-horizon-harness

# 2. GCP access for Vertex inference (needs a project with BILLING enabled)
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project <your-project-id>          # or leave your gcloud default
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com     # the Vertex AI API

# 3. Run — the first run installs deps and seeds .env from .env.example
make dev-local                                 # backend :8001 + web UI :3000
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>, or run one-shot from the terminal with `agents-cli run "your prompt"`. To install without starting servers: `make setup`.

> **Cost:** the test suites (`tests/unit` / `tests/integration`) run free with no GCP. Everything else calls **Vertex, which is billed per token**, so you need a project with billing enabled. `make deploy` additionally stands up always-on resources (Cloud SQL, Cloud Scheduler) — see [Deploy](#deploy) for teardown.

`make dev-local` is the simplest way to start: tools run on your host, sessions stay in-process, and no sandbox, Agent Platform Sessions, or Cloud SQL is provisioned. The trade-off is **no cross-session memory** and **no isolated sandbox** (tools run directly on your machine); inference still calls Vertex (there is no local model — `local` only moves **tool execution** to your host). If `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` is blank in `.env`, `make dev` falls back to your active `gcloud` project; switch to the Agent Platform sandbox with `LHA_ENVIRONMENT_BACKEND=sandbox` (or `make dev-sandbox`).

### Testing

Deterministic tests need no GCP; evals hit Vertex and are billed like any other call.

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit tests/integration   # deterministic — no GCP needed
agents-cli eval run                          # grades behavior against tests/eval/evalsets/*.json
```

## Learn & adapt

Horizon is a sample — **configure it with environment variables and adapt it by editing the code** (there's no wrapper API). Where to go next:

- **The custom interfaces** → [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — each row links to the function that implements it.
- **Architecture** → [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) — the map + per-subsystem start-here files (and the runtime diagram).
- **Adapt / extend** → [`docs/extending.md`](docs/extending.md) — swap the model, add tools/routes, plug a custom sandbox, teach it skills.
- **Configuration** → [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md) — every environment variable + dependency extra.
- **Security** → [`docs/security-model.md`](docs/security-model.md) — Horizon trusts the LLM within tool- and sandbox-level guardrails (identity, the guard chain, what each route exposes). Review it before pointing it at anything real.

## Deploy

`make deploy` is **one command** that provisions infrastructure *and* ships code, in three steps:

1. **Terraform** (`terraform/`) provisions the foundation (Cloud SQL, Secret Manager, IAM service accounts + roles, Cloud Scheduler jobs, IAP, GCS buckets, required-API enablement), plus the two Cloud Run **skeletons** (`lha` backend, `lha-web` IAP proxy) with placeholder images.
2. **`agents-cli deploy`** builds + rolls the real backend image onto `lha`.
3. **Cloud Build + `gcloud run deploy`** builds + rolls the web image onto `lha-web`.

Both services `ignore_changes` on their image, so steps 2–3 never fight Terraform. Prereqs: `terraform`, `agents-cli`, `gcloud`, and a project (`gcloud config set project <id>` or `PROJECT_ID=<id> make deploy`).

> **IAP access is empty by default.** Set `TF_VAR_iap_users='["user:you@example.com"]'` before `make deploy` (or re-run after) or you'll be locked out of the web UI.

**Billable, always-on resources** (Cloud SQL especially) — tear everything down when you're done. Container images pushed to Artifact Registry (`cloud-run-source-deploy`) are not Terraform-managed and survive `make destroy`; delete them separately if you care about the storage:

```bash
make destroy   # flips the delete guards off, then terraform destroy of all the above
```
