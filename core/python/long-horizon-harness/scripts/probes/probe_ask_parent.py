"""Live-LLM smoke for the child ``ask_parent`` escalation channel.

Drives the REAL Horizon runner (real root + child Gemini models) so a delegated
child hits a decision it cannot make, calls ``ask_parent``, the question surfaces
to the "user" as an ``adk_request_confirmation``, we answer with FREE TEXT, and
the child resumes in place and reports the answer.

Run:  (env from .env)  uv run python scripts/probes/probe_ask_parent.py
Hits Vertex — needs GCP auth + GOOGLE_CLOUD_* set.
