"""Live-LLM smoke for ``agent(action='wait')`` (fleet next-completed).

Spawns two REAL child agents (real Gemini) in the background, then uses the new
``wait`` action to collect them one at a time and confirms the fleet drains.

Run:  (env from .env)  uv run python scripts/probes/probe_subagent_wait.py
Hits Vertex — needs GCP auth + GOOGLE_CLOUD_* set.
