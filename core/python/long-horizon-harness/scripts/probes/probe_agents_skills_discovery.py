"""Live smoke: a skill staged where `npx skills add` puts it is auto-discovered.

Seeds a distinctive skill under ``<workspace>/.agents/skills/<name>/`` (the
Skills CLI staging location) — NOT under ``skills/`` — then drives the REAL
root agent (real Gemini). Proves the whole chain:

  1. code-level: the skill appears in ``bound_skill_catalog()`` after the
     session-start mirror (i.e. ``.agents/skills`` is now a discovered root),
  2. live-model: the model can read a UNIQUE token from that skill's injected
     ``<available_skills>`` catalog entry — proving it's actually surfaced to
     the model, not just on disk.

Run:  (env from .env)  uv run python scripts/probes/probe_agents_skills_discovery.py
Hits Vertex — needs GCP auth + GOOGLE_CLOUD_* set. LHA_ENVIRONMENT_BACKEND=local.
