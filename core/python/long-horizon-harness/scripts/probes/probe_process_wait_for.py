"""Live-LLM smoke for ``process(action='wait_for', pattern=...)``.

Drives the REAL root agent (real Gemini) to start a background command that
prints a readiness marker after a delay, then block on ``wait_for`` until the
marker appears — the "start a dev server, wait until it's ready" pattern without
polling.

Run:  (env from .env)  uv run python scripts/probes/probe_process_wait_for.py
Hits Vertex — needs GCP auth + GOOGLE_CLOUD_* set.
