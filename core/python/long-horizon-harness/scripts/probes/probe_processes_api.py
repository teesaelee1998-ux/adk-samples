"""Live smoke for the /lha/processes surface (Background panel backend).

Drives the REAL root agent (real Gemini) to start a background `terminal`
process, then exercises the actual HTTP route the web panel uses:
``GET /lha/processes`` must list it and ``DELETE /lha/processes/{id}`` must
kill it. Validates the whole model -> tool -> registry -> API -> kill chain.

Run:  (env from .env)  uv run python scripts/probes/probe_processes_api.py
Hits Vertex — needs GCP auth + GOOGLE_CLOUD_* set. LHA_ENVIRONMENT_BACKEND=local.
